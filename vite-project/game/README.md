# Pacmanuel: The Eternal Chase for GPA

## The Tale of JI Students

In the mystical halls of UM-SJTU Joint Institute, where dreams of engineering excellence float through the air like quantum particles, a peculiar phenomenon occurs every semester. Professor Manuel, keeper of coding standards and guardian of proper documentation, roams the digital corridors with his red pen of deduction.

Legend speaks of students, transformed into blue tigers by the ancient magic of JI, desperately collecting knowledge beans to maintain their precious GPAs. These beans, manifestations of proper variable naming and perfect code indentation, are scattered throughout the labyrinthine halls of the institute.

But beware! Manuel, with his eagle eyes for imperfect code and his supernatural ability to detect missing comments, phases through walls and corridors, pursuing the students with unwavering dedication. His famous catchphrase echoes through the halls: "Minus 5 points for improper documentation!"

Yet hope remains! Sacred buff powerups, blessed by the spirits of successful alumni, appear randomly throughout the maze. Some say these buffs contain the essence of perfect coding practices, temporarily protecting students from Manuel's deductions.
